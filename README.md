# 👋 Hi, I'm Salvatore J. Amico

Welcome to my GitHub!  
I’m a Computer Science student at the **University of Illinois Chicago (UIC)**, currently working toward my **B.S. in Computer Science** (expected December 2025) and planning to continue immediately into the **M.S. in Computer Science** at the **University of Illinois Springfield (UIS)** — specializing in **AI and Data Science**, along with a **Graduate Certificate in Data Analytics**.

## 🧠 About Me

My journey into computer science started with a fascination for how intelligence can be modeled and automated — from small embedded systems to large-scale AI applications.  
At UIC, I’ve built projects across **machine learning**, **databases**, **systems performance**, and **object-oriented programming**, while continuously expanding my toolkit with technologies like **Python, C++, Java, Ruby, and Rust**.

Outside of coursework, I develop tools like **Commandly**, a cross-platform voice-to-command desktop assistant powered by OpenAI APIs, designed to bridge human interaction with automation. I’m also exploring opportunities in **AI engineering** and **data-driven software development**, aiming to merge usability with intelligence.

## 🎯 Current Goals

- 🔍 Strengthen expertise in **AI, data science, and automation frameworks**.  
- 💼 Secure a **remote software or AI engineering role** aligned with applied machine learning and intelligent systems.  
- 🧩 Continue building open-source projects that integrate **voice, vision, and automation**.  
- 📈 Refine my skills in **Rust**, **NumPy/SciPy**, and **data visualization**.
